# Dynamic User Details Application

Hi Team,

This is my first application project at Volante Tech.

## Project Overview

I created the Dynamic User Details Application using Angular with Firebase Firestore Database. This application has a pre-built user list in the Firestore DB and currently does not have sign-up functionalities. Users can authenticate through the login page using the pre-built user list.

## Features

This application was developed using mid-level Angular concepts. The key features include:

1. **Data Transfer**: Data transfer between child to parent using @Output event emitter method and parent to child using @Input method.
2. **Firebase Firestore**: Used Firebase Firestore database for data handling, with implemented get and update methods.
3. **Dynamic Data Loading**: Loads dynamic data based on the logged-in user.
4. **Firebase Authentication**: Firebase authentication system for the application login page.
5. **Styling**: Bootstrap used for styling and grid system.

## Pre-Built Users

You can use the following credentials to log in with different user accounts:

| Username          | Password  |
|-------------------|-----------|
| gobi@gmail.com    | 12345678  |
| ezhil@gmail.com   | 12345678  |
| thusha@gmail.com  | 12345678  |
| ruhi@gmail.com    | 12345678  |
| karthik@gmail.com | 12345678  |
| kesav@gmail.com   | 12345678  |

## Configuration

# Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
